Well, it's finally done! The site is up, and you can navigate to it. *Phew*!

Surprisingly, it took longer to get it up than I thought. Previously, I had another site up but, as I said before, it really wasn't set up very well. So, going into this, I thought that knowledge should transfer laterally. Sadly, I was only half-right.

Setting up the domain name register was pretty painless, and fortunately the theme had good documentation so the basics wend down decently well too. Unfortunately, that's where my knowledge ended.

After all of this, I ended up learning about [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions). My knowledge-set isn't complete on these topics yet, but I hope to learn more about them as I continue developing this site. Man, the internet is a fantastic thing!

At the moment, my workflow goes: make changes with VS Code or write blog-posts in Obsidian, run `pnpm run dev`, squash bugs, then push to the main site. I know this is not the most complicated process, but its what I've found that works. There are most definitely more proper methods of website development, so I hope to learn more about them as I progress.

Who knew there was so much to learn.
